        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between Java and Python?</summary>
            <p>Java is a statically typed language, which means types are checked at compile-time. Python is dynamically typed, with types checked at runtime. <br>Java is faster in execution, while Python is easier for rapid development due to its simplicity
                and vast libraries.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>What are the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</summary>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulation:</li>Bundling data and methods together. <br>
                    <li>Inheritance:</li> Deriving new classes from existing ones. <br>
                    <li>Polymorphism:</li>Methods or functions behaving differently based on inputs. <br>
                    <li>Abstraction: </li> Hiding implementation details from the user.</p>
            </ul>
        </details><br>
        <details>
            <summary>How does SQL differ from NoSQL databases?</summary>
            <p>SQL databases are relational and use structured query language for managing data, best for structured data. <br> NoSQL databases are non-relational, handle unstructured data, and offer flexibility in schema design.</p>
        </details><br>
        <details>
            <summary>Can you explain the importance of CSS in web development?</summary>
